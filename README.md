# stanfordnlp_chinese_coreference

Build training/set dataset for Chinese coreference resolution using results from stanfordNLP's coreference resolver, 
but considerring the fact that stanford only has a F-score around 50 for chinese coreference, which means the results from it
are not reliable enough to train our model (using Memory Network). This project will be temporarily aborted unless any 
feasible solution to building training dataset is uncovered.
